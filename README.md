## Econometrics project: Stock Price Forecasting (BlackRock)
## Project Overview

This project, carried out as part of the Econometrics course at the University of Padua, aimed to forecast BlackRockâ€™s stock price and analyze its volatility dynamics. The goal was to bridge theoretical econometric models with real-world financial data, assessing their effectiveness and adaptability in practice.

## Objectives

Improve forecasting accuracy of financial time series.
Perform volatility modeling and analysis.
Evaluate the impact of exogenous variables (S&P500 index and VIX).
Compare different econometric models to assess robustness.

## Methodology

The project was implemented in R, week by week, developing and testing a range of models, both univariate and multivariate:
- ARIMA / ARMA models for time series forecasting
- GARCH-family models to capture volatility clustering
    -  Standard GARCH
    -  TGARCH and EGARCH (to address asymmetry issues)
    -  GARCH with alternative distributions
- ARMA-GARCH combined models
- VAR models with exogenous variables (S&P500, VIX)

This was a group project, carried out collaboratively with fellow students. The teamwork aspect was crucial for: sharing model insights and coding strategies, critically interpreting results, and reaching common solutions through discussion and comparison.
